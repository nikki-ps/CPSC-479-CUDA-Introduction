# CPSC-479-CUDA-Introduction
Exercise 1. Write a CUDA program to initialize an array of size 32 to all zeros in parallel.

Exercise 2. In addition to what Problem 1 asks, change the array size to 1024.

Exercise 3. In addition to Problem 1 and Problem 2 ask, create another kernel that adds i to array[i].

Exercise 4. In addition to Problem 1 and Problem 2 ask, change the array size to 8000. Check if the answer to problem 3 still works.
